Spellcasters is a single tap game where you should defend the main character from the enemies approaching. Perhaps the mechanics are simple, we think they are somehow hard to domain.

The main task is to help the magician keep enemies away during its journey through several locations. Earn coins by defeating enemies and unlock new playable characters.

As a secondary task, you may sign in using your Google's account and complete all challenges. These challenges will add points for your Google's profile.
