Le Gatuno is a platform game with a little bit of strategy. The main task is to help the cat to reach the fish before the time runs out, as secondary mission you can collect the 3 stars available in each stage.

The game mechanics are simple, the cat runs by itself and will jump at your command. Hence, the input is basically one button. It will change its direction on collision with a block.

This game was created during the [GBJAM15](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-5/rate/88875) where it got its first release under the label "demo" in October 9th 2016. At this point, the game contained 10 different levels and several game-breaker bugs.

However, the development would not finished until January 7th when it was published on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.InformalPenguins.LeGatuno). Then, the game engine was rebuilt mostly, fixing bugs & adding 30 different levels. Other feature added for its launching was the flying cats, an easier way to finish levels.
