This year, we participated on the epic Global Game Jam. I believe this is the biggest game jam in the world. Let's talk about numbers: more than 36,000 participants in 702 sites across 95 countries, over 7,000 games created.

Like every year, all people should stick to the [jam's theme: **waves**.](http://globalgamejam.org/news/theme-global-game-jam-2017-%E2%80%A6)

Yeah, waves. However you want to interpret it. This means, it could be waves on the beach, water waves, sound waves, sin/cos graphs... or the typical mexican wave:

So, it began...

The image above is one of the early paper designs. It's funny because it looks pretty close to the final result.

This is an early to-do list. All the game's concept was too abstract. We needed to land all the ideas into detailed descriptions, models, diagrams. We divided the work: [Vincent](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008341606804) was creating the character's models meanwhile I was developing a proof of concept of the game idea.

It's hard to code without any direction, so I like to draw class diagrams. It doesn't matter if the game is simple, it helps me to have a better idea of what I'm doing, it also improves my memorization. Did I mention I have fish memory span?

The next pic is a last minute to-do list. We had a harsh time looking for sounds & music. Vincent is an 3D artist, I'm a coder, our team didn't have any musical talent. The bunch of numbers in the bottom part are my calculations, we added [eye tracker device](http://gatomocho.com/2017/01/18/tobii-eyex.html) compatibility.

At the end, we came up with this videogame:
